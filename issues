1. Card
   --Has Fixed Div called body and content which takes up some height but footer is slotted
   --last-child selector not working inside component but outside sdom

2. DataGrid
   --Need to use component like sp-table-head (content and sp-table-body optional) else receive console error on query selector

3. Icons
   --Need to use component sp-icon-medium/large to add named icons
   --sizes seems bit different from original documentation eg: cross300 vs cross75
   --Cant break sp-icons-medium tag in multi line or add space btw tags throws console error
   --No state styling works - hover, active, focus, ... can see changes from inspector
